# IOT
In the course the students will learn how to develop applications for the smart city
environment under the cloud computing paradigm. We will use the IaaS infrastructure and
create an interface between IoT devices and a Cloud IaaS. Will be learned to operate and
communicate between sensors located on embedded computing systems and reporting
data to cloud servers.

“Petcare” is an IOT-based system designed to automate feeding, track the consumption of food and water, and deliver snacks and toys for pets.
